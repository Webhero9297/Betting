The history of this project simple. There were some client that asked me to implement sports bets on ethereum smart contracts. Technical task were next: "I want sports bet project on smart contracts".
But after I've implemented the last part we agreed, client told that he requested only 1/4 of all project, and did not pay for the last part. At really he asked to make 3/4 of the project.
Since I did not sign any NDA and client broke our voice agreement, I have rights for this project. Thats all.

Architecture:
- UI(latest Angular,DEMO: http://wizardly-hugle-9ff596.bitballoon.com) should be integrated with public backend(which is not implemented), and use bet function from smart contract. Bet event should be added.
- DAPP solidity smart contract
- isolated backend(node.js), that acting as a simple wrapper around smart contract. 
- public backend, which is not implemented. Should interact with UI and isolated backend.

Details:
It should create games in the blockchain on demand, to prevent losing on not popular games. Also DAPP Game creation should be protected by captcha.


There is only 3/4 of overall project ready. This repo contains smart contract and UI code. Isolated backend : https://github.com/vitaliy-kuzmich/bets-backend


This is free software.
